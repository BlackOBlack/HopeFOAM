Description
    This is a guidebook for installing HopeFOAM which is based on OpenFOAM-4.0.
    Compared with OpenFOAM installation, it is basically the same.

\*---------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

1.Pre-requisites
    Compiler: GCC >= 4.8.0
	      gfortran

2.The first step is the same as the OpenFOAM-4.0 installation. Actually, this part is
  used to install OpenFOAM-4.0 on the computer. There is some advice shown as below.
  If there are still errors in the process of HopeFOAM installation, the website
  <http://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Installation> can give you a more detailed
  installation process of OpenFOAM-4.0. 

	(1) MPI, cmake, boost-1.55.0 and CGAL-4.8 are needed:
		a. Install cmake and one type of mpi on the computer, and set the mpi type $WM_MPLIB and its
		   installation path;
		   
		   Edit file HopeFOAM-0.1/etc/config.sh/mpi, modify $MPI_ARCH_PATH according to mpi type
		   ------------------------------------------------------------------------
		   $MPI_ARCH_PATH=<Installation path of mpi>
		   ------------------------------------------------------------------------
		   
		   Edit file HopeFOAM-0.1/etc/bashrc. Then source it;
		   ------------------------------------------------------------------------
		   export WM_MPLIB=<MPI on computer>
		   ------------------------------------------------------------------------
		
		b. According to your operating system type and compiler, modify the compiling
		   option in directory of HopeFOAM-0.1/etc/wmake.
		
		c. Download boost-1.55.0 and CGAL-4.8 source code, unzip them to HopeFOAM/ThirdParty-0.1.
		   Edit line 69 of Allwmake and make it the same as the path of libmpi.so: 
		   ------------------------------------------------------------------------
		   $MPI_ARCH_PATH/lib${WM_COMPILER_LIB_ARCH}/libmpi.so
		   ------------------------------------------------------------------------
		
		d. Execute the command as below:
		   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		   cd $HOME/HopeFOAM
		   sed -i -e 's/\(boost_version=\)boost-system/\1boost-1.55.0/' HopeFOAM-0.1/etc/config.sh/CGAL
		   sed -i -e 's/\(cgal_version=\)cgal-system/\1CGAL-0.1/' HopeFOAM-0.1/etc/config.sh/CGAL
		   sed -i -e 's=\-lmpfr=-lmpfr -lboost_thread=' HopeFOAM-0.1/wmake/rules/General/CGAL
		   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		e. Rename the source code folder of boost to "boost-1.55.0";
		
		f. Jump to /HoepFOAM/ThirdParty-0.1, and execute command ./Allwmake.
	
		Noteï¼šAfter these steps, the installation path of CGAL-4.8 and boost-1.55.0 is $CGAL_ARCH_PATH
		      and $BOOST_ARCH_PATH. 
			  
		      Of course, you can manually install CGAL-4.8 and boost-1.55.0, and it is easy to find
		      install guide from the Internet. "--with-libraries=thread --with-libraries=system" needs
		      to be added as below, when you install boost-1.55.0.
		      -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		      ./bootstrap.sh --with-libraries=thread --with-libraries=system
		      -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			  
		      After you install CGAL-4.8 and boost-1.55.0 in another directory, please
		      set their path in /HopeFOAM/HopeFOAM-0.1/etc/config.sh/CGAL.
			  
			  
        (2) Source HopeFOAM-0.1/etc/basrc to update environment variables of HoepFOAM.
	
        (3) Modify the type of MPI, Compiler, etc. Update configuration with source command.
		
            #Edit file $WM_PROJECT_DIR/etc/bashrc to modify some keywords.
            -----------------------------------------------------------------------
            WM_COMPILER_TYPE: set the compiler;
            -----------------------------------------------------------------------
			  
	(4)Jump to the directory of $WM_PROJECT_DIR and install HopeFOAM.
		
	    ./AllwmakeOpenFOAM
		
3.After step 2, external packages are needed by HopeFOAM, and we need to install them to
  install the rest part of HopeFOAM. First, Download PETSc-3.7.6 and SLEPC-3.7.4 source
  code from
  http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/download/index.html
  http://slepc.upv.es/download/download.htm


3.Then, install PETSc-3.7.6 and SLEPC-3.7.4 on computer and make sure they run
  normally. Installation guide of PETSc-3.7.6 and SLEPC-3.7.4 are shown as
  Appendix 1 and 2 respectively.


4.Next, add $PETSC_DIR and $SLEPC_DIR into $HOME/.bashrc, which are the installation
  paths of PETSc and SLEPc, and add them to $LD_LIBRARY_DIR.(Note: Not the paths
  of source code)

    vi $HOME/.bashrc
    #Add content below into $HOME/.bashrc
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
        export PETSC_DIR=<Installation directory of PETSc-3.7.6>
        export SLEPC_DIR=<Installation directory of SLEPc-3.7.4>
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<Installation directory of PETSc-3.7.6>/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<Installation directory of SLEPc-3.7.4>/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    source $HOME/.bashrc


5.Finally, install the part of DG on your system.

    ./AllwmakeDG

	           #                                   #
		   # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
/**************************************************************************************\

1.Download the source code of PETSc-3.7.6.


2.To install PETSc-3.7.6, lapack is needed. If your system does not install it, the
  steps below are the lapack installation guide, which can also be found in its official
  website<http://www.netlib.org/lapack/#_users_guide>.
  
  (1) Download lapack-3.5.0 source code from <http://www.netlib.org/lapack/#_lapack_version_3_5_0>.
      Decompress source code package, and copy the file make.inc.example

        tar -zxvf <source_code>.tgz
	cd lapack-3.5.0
	cp make.inc.example make.inc
  
  (2) Edit make.inc to suit your operating system and change the name of BLAS library
      in make.inc.

	------------------------------------------
	BLASLIB      = ../../libblas.a
	------------------------------------------
  
  (3) If your operating system has installed Blas, this step can be ignored.
      Change content of "Makefile" as shown below:

        ------------------------------------------
        lib: lapacklib tmglib
        #lib: blaslib variants lapacklib tmglib
        ------------------------------------------
                        ||
                       _||_ 
                       \  /	
		        \/
        ------------------------------------------
        #lib: lapacklib tmglib
        lib: blaslib variants lapacklib tmglib
        ------------------------------------------

  (4) After these step, execute 'make' to finish lapack-3.5.0 installation:

        make


3.Then PETSc-3.7.6 installation can start. Decompress PETSc source code .tar.gz with
  command:

    tar -zxvf <source_code>.tar.gz


4.To set some paths, compile source code in its directory with command:

    ./configure --prefix=<Installation path of PETSC-3.7.6> --download-hypre 
	        --with-debugging=0 COPTFLAGS=-O3 CXXOPTFLAGS=-O3 --with-blas-lapack-dir=<lapack installation path>

  Note: --prefix=<path>: used for setting installation path.
            Installation path of PETSC-3.7.6 is different from the directory of source
	    code. You can choose the path by yourself as the installation directory.
	--download-hypre: used for installing hypre(PETSc external package), which is
            needed by HopeFOAM. If your operating system does not connect to the Internet,
	    you need to download the hypre external package by yourself and set the path
	    of hypre package:
        --download-hypre=<Path of Hypre External Package>
	    The hypre package can be downloaded from its official website:
	    <https://computation.llnl.gov/projects/hypre-scalable-linear-solvers-multigrid-methods/software>
		
        --with-debugging=0 COPTFLAGS=-O3 CXXOPTFLAGS=-O3: used to set PETSc as be opt
            version. If delete this option, PETSc will be debug version.

        --with-mpi-dir=<MPI Path>: only used when your operating system has several
            types of MPI. Then you need to select one of them.
			
	--with-blas-lapack-dir: used for setting lapack installation path.
		
        There are more compiling option on PETSc`s official website
        <http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/documentation/installation.html>.
	Also, your can get help with command:
	    ./configure --help
	

5.Finally, just follow the step given by system after each command. It will
  be like below:

    make PETSC_DIR=<source code path> PETSC_ARCH=arch-linux2-c-opt all
    make PETSC_DIR=<source code path> PETSC_ARCH=arch-linux2-c-opt install
    make PETSC_DIR=<installation path> PETSC_ARCH="" test

    Note: After these commands, you can ignore the rest given by the system.
          When the 3rd command finished, congratulations, you have installed
	  PETSc-3.7.6 successfully.

1. Download the source code of SLEPc-3.7.4.
   Note: Before SLEPc installation, PETSc is necessary.


2. Decompress SLEPc source code .tar.gz with command:

    tar -zxvf <source_code>.tar.gz


3. Go to source code directory, and check environment variables $PETSC_DIR and $PETSC_ARCH:

    echo $PETSC_DIR

   If $PETSC_DIR is different from your installation path of PETSc:

    export PETSC_DIR=<PETSc installation path>

4. Unset environment variable $PETSC_ARCH

    unset PETSC_ARCH

5. Set source code path as enviroment variable $SLEPC_DIR:

    export SLEPC_DIR=<slepc source code path>

6. Then excute commands as below:

    ./configure --prefix=<installation path>
    make
    make install
    export SLEPC_DIR=<installation path>

    Note: Installation path is different from the source code path.
